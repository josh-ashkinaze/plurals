def print_anes_mapping():
    """
    Prints the values of ANES mapping in a human-readable format.

    The purpose of this function is that in some cases users will want to conduct their own query on the ANES
    dataset, but it is difficult to know what the values are without consulting a codebook.

    Note that when generating personas we recode certain values but you should use original
    values for filtering data, as they are printed here.

    Here are the cases we recode values:

    - ``child18`` asks participants if they have children under 18 living in their household. We recode ``Yes`` to ``do have
      children under 18 living in your household`` and ``No`` to ``do not have children under 18 living in your household``.

    - Several questions have multiple choice options (A, B, C) and then an ``Other`` option. We recode ``Other``
      as ``neither A nor B nor C`` to be more explicit.

class SmartString(str):
    """
    A custom string class with several nice features for this package.

    Features
    --------


    1. Safe String Formatting
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Overrides the format method to use ``safe_substitute`` from ``string.Template``.

    Problem it fixes:
        Users often have JSON-like strings in their tasks, which can cause errors with normal string formatting.

    Explanation:
        Python's standard string formatting uses curly braces, which can break when the string contains curly braces NOT meant for replacement.
        SmartString uses ``string.Template.safe_substitute()`` to safely replace variables, avoiding these problems.

    2. Avoid Double Periods
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Prevents double periods at the end of formatted strings.

    Problem it fixes:
        When a replacement value ends with a period and the original string also ends with a period, it results in an undesired double period.

    Example:
        >>> task = SmartString("Complete the following task: {task}.")
        >>> task.format(task="Do the thing.")
        'Complete the following task: Do the thing.'

        **Without** this feature, the output would be:
        'Complete the following task: Do the thing..'

    3. None Replacement
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Replaces 'None' with an empty string during string creation.

    Problem it fixes:
        ``str(None)`` returns the string 'None', but for the ``Agent.process`` function, it's preferable to replace 'None' with an empty string.

    Example:
        >>> SmartString(None)
        ''
        >>> str(None)
        'None'

    Notes
    -----
    - The `format` method uses `string.Template.safe_substitute()` internally.
    - Double periods are automatically avoided unless specified otherwise.
    - 'None' is replaced with an empty string during string creation.
    """

    def __new__(cls, content):
        # Replace 'None' with an empty string during string creation
        if isinstance(content, str):
            content = content.replace('None', '')
        return super().__new__(cls, content)

    def format(self, avoid_double_period=True, **kwargs):
        """
        Override the format method to use string.Template for string formatting.

        Also, if ``avoid_double_period`` is True, then we will remove the trailing period from the formatted string if it
        is already present. This happens if the string is like `Complete the following task: {task}.` and the user passes `task=Do
        the thing`. In this case, the default output would have an extra period: `Complete the following task: Do the thing..`

        Double-period algorithm:

        Foreach key, value in kwargs:

        1. Construct a placeholder-plus-period like "{task}." (assuming {task} is placeholder here)

        2. Check if the placeholder-plus-period is in the string AND the replacement ends with a period.

        3. If both conditions are met, replace the replacement-plus-period with just the replacement.

        Args:
            avoid_double_period (bool): Whether to avoid double periods in the final string. (Default: True)
            **kwargs: Key-value pairs to replace in the string.
        Returns:
            str: The formatted string.

        Notes:
            - In edge case where the value for a key is None, we replace it with an empty string. Example of this:
            >>> task = SmartString("Complete the following task: {task}.")
            >>> task.format(task=None)
            'Complete the following task: .'
