def print_anes_mapping():
    """
    Prints the values of ANES mapping in a human-readable format.

    The purpose of this function is that in some cases users will want to conduct their own query on the ANES
    dataset, but it is difficult to know what the values are without consulting a codebook.

    Note that when generating personas we recode certain values but you should use original
    values for filtering data, as they are printed here.

    Here are the cases we recode values:

    - ``child18`` asks participants if they have children under 18 living in their household. We recode ``Yes`` to ``do have
      children under 18 living in your household`` and ``No`` to ``do not have children under 18 living in your household``.

    - Several questions have multiple choice options (A, B, C) and then an ``Other`` option. We recode ``Other``
      as ``neither A nor B nor C`` to be more explicit.

    A custom string class that overrides the format method to use string.Template's safe substitute.

    Problem it fixes: Oftentimes users will have some kind of json string in their task and this throws an error with
    normal strings.

    Longer explanation: The format method of the str class uses the curly braces syntax for string formatting. This
    breaks when the string `s` contains curly braces that are not meant to be replaced. So as a solution one can turn
    `s` into a string Template and use the `safe_substitute` method to replace the variables. This is what the
    SmartString class does: It is a subclass of str that overrides the format method to use `string.Template` for
    string formatting.

        Override the format method to use string.Template for string formatting.

        Also, if avoid_double_period is True, then we will remove the trailing period from the formatted string if it
        is already present. This happens if the string is like `Complete the {task}.` and the user passes `task=Do
        the thing`. In this case, we want to remove the extra period. This is particularly useful for Moderator
        personas where in defaults they often end on the task.

        1. Construct a placeholder-plus-period like "{task}." (assuming {task} is placeholder here)
