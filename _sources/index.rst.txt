Welcome to Plurals docs!
===================================

There are essentially two parts to this documentation. The first is a set of tutorials, which includes a bunch of examples.
And the second is the lower-level API documentation.

Because we very recently released this package, there may be: (1) things you would like to be more clearly documented or (2)
things you want to do but this cannot do. We have issue templates for feature requests and documentation requests `here <https://github.com/josh-ashkinaze/plurals/issues/new/choose>`_.
